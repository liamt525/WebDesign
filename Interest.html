    <h1>Ski Mountain Reviews</h1>
    <h2>By: Liam Tomaszewski</h2>
    <p1>Welcome to Ski Mountain Reviews by Liam Tomaszewski.  On this site you will find reviews for various mountains in the Northeast and out west in the Rockies.  When I started skiing, I wanted to make sure that I was going to the right mountains for my level.  I want you to have the same experience.  What are you waiting for?  Go get some skis and I'll catch you on the slopes</p1>
    <p2>By the way, lodging means hotels not the the actual lodge.
Don't get intimidated by any ski mountain.  All of them are great and I recommend ski school for any beginner skier or anyone who wants a lesson.
I will be updating this site time to time to add new places I have been to!!!
